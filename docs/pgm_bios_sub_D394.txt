PGM BIOS Function: sub_D394 (Latch Command Pending Flag)
---------------------------------------------------
Summary: Sets the 16-bit flag at 0x80374E to 1 and returns. This flag is referenced by the service-command queue to indicate that at least one message is waiting to be flushed to hardware.

Assembly:
  D394: move.w #1, (unk_80374E).l
  D39C: rts

Behaviour:
- Writes the literal value 1 to the global `unk_80374E`.
- No registers are preserved; the caller must save anything live.

C-style equivalent:
```c
void pgm_set_queue_pending(void) {
    *(volatile uint16_t *)0x80374E = 1;
}
```

Analysis notes:
- There is no matching routine in the BIOS that clears this flag; higher-level code likely zeroes it manually once the pending command FIFO drains.
- Because the location sits in work RAM, writes are immediate and do not require handshake with external devices.
