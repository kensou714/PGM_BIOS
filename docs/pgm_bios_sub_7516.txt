PGM BIOS Function: sub_7516 (Formatted Text Renderer, Minimal)
-------------------------------------------------------------
Summary: Convenience wrapper around sub_74CC for simple banners. It formats a printf-style string with sub_7222 and renders it with sub_6E72 using default placement (mode 0, zero base/column/kerning/font). Used by the fatal assert path and other quick notifications.

Prototype (conceptual):
    void pgm_renderf_basic(uint32_t base, const char *fmt, ...);

Inputs:
- arg_0: destination pointer forwarded to sub_6E72 arg_0 (rendering mode).
- arg_4: base tile offset (maps to sub_6E72 arg_4).
- arg_8: format string.
- arg_C+: var-arguments consumed by sub_7222.

Behaviour outline:
1. Allocate the same 0x80-byte stack buffer as sub_74CC.
2. Call sub_7222(buffer, fmt, &arg_C) to expand the message.
3. Invoke sub_6E72 with the formatted buffer while zeroing the optional parameters (column, kerning, font index).
4. Scan the resulting string to find its length and advance the caller supplied output pointer accordingly.

Notes:
- Because column/kerning/font are zeroed, the output lands at the default service text origin using the primary font.
- sub_7516 shares the same temporary buffer and helper chain as sub_74CC; it merely supplies constant parameters.
- Fatal assertions and diagnostics call this helper so they can supply fmt, file, and line without worrying about placement.
