PGM BIOS Helper: sub_7F6A (Sprite Strip Builder)
--------------------------------------------
Summary: Converts a character count into a sprite strip buffer ready for DMA to VRAM. The routine validates the requested mode (`arg_4`), computes the buffer size, and multiplies the character count by stride values to return the total byte length in D0.

Parameters:
- arg_0: pointer to sprite data (destination buffer).
- arg_4: mode selector (0, 1, or 2). Values outside 0?2 trigger a diagnostic via `sub_7FCC`.
- D2 (upon entry): character count (set by caller before pushing args).

Behaviour:
1. Validates `arg_4` (mode). If mode ? 3, prints warning "Bank0 bank move" and proceeds with default.
2. Calculates output length based on mode:
   - Mode 0: length = count >> 5 (divide by 32).
   - Mode 1: length = count / 640 (`0x280`) via `sub_D874` (division helper).
   - Mode 2: length = count >> 1.
3. Returns resulting length in D0, preserving D2/D3 across the call.

Usage:
- Called by text renderer `sub_6E72` to build per-line sprite strips for the service UI.
- Combined with `pgm_bios_fill_blocks` or `sub_D80A` to place the strips into VRAM.

Notes:
- Diagnostic strings (`"Bank0 bank move"`, `"C image C"`) imply this helper was used during firmware development to catch misuse.
- Division helpers `sub_D874` provide a verified quotient and remainder for non-power-of-two strides.
- D0 (return value) often feeds into `sub_D80A` to obtain final offsets.
