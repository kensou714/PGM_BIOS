PGM BIOS Function: sub_B512 (Packed BCD Byte -> Integer)
---------------------------------------------------
Summary: Decodes a packed BCD byte (high nibble = tens, low nibble = units) into a binary integer. Widely used when parsing RTC values and score tables stored as BCD.

Assembly highlights:
- 0xB518?0xB520: isolates the high nibble and converts it into a base-ten value (n * 10).
- 0xB52A?0xB530: masks the low nibble and adds it to the accumulator.
- 0xB532: restores D2 and returns with the computed integer in D0.

Behaviour:
1. Preserve D2 because the caller may rely on it.
2. Extract the high nibble, multiply by 10 (via 4x + 1x followed by doubling).
3. Add the low nibble to complete the decimal value.
4. Return the result in D0.

C-style sketch:
```c
uint16_t pgm_bcd_byte_to_uint(uint8_t packed_bcd) {
    uint8_t tens = (packed_bcd >> 4) & 0x0F;
    uint8_t ones = packed_bcd & 0x0F;
    return (uint16_t)(tens * 10 + ones);
}
```

Analysis notes:
- Only the low byte of the argument is examined; higher bits are ignored.
- No range checking is performed, so invalid BCD digits (>9) spill directly into the decimal output.
- D1 is used as a temporary but is freely clobbered; callers must not expect it to survive.
