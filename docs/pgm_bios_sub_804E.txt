PGM BIOS Function: sub_804E (Restore Interrupt Mask)
---------------------------------------------------
Summary: Restores the Motorola 68000 interrupt priority to the value previously saved at 0x803442. The helper simply reads the stored level, calls sub_8002(level), and returns.

Behaviour:
1. Push the 16-bit value at absolute address 0x803442 onto the stack.
2. Branch to sub_8002 to write that level into the status register mask.
3. Pop the temporary argument and return.

C-style equivalent:
    void pgm_restore_irq_mask(void)
    {
        uint16_t level = *(volatile uint16_t *)0x803442;
        pgm_set_sr_mask(level);    // sub_8002
    }

Notes:
- Pairs with sub_8038. Routines that raise the mask to level 7 should call this helper once the critical section completes.
- Assumes 0x803442 was initialised (e.g., via sub_8038). If not, the behaviour is undefined (whatever value resides there will be written to SR).
