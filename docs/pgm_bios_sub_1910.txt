PGM BIOS Function: sub_1910 (Pending Flag Stub)
----------------------------------------------
Summary: Returns constant 1, acting as a placeholder for a routine that should test whether pending events exist.

Assembly listing:
```asm
0x1910: moveq #1, d0
0x1912: rts
```

Reconstructed C implementation:
```c
uint32_t pgm_pending_flag(void) {
    return 1;
}
```

Analysis notes:
- Called before sub_190C in polling routines; a non-zero return signals the caller to fall back to table-based checks.
- In this BIOS build it forces the fallback path, effectively disabling the fast-match early return.
- When reconstructing more complete firmware expect this function to reflect hardware state (e.g., checking an interrupt latch or a queued flag).
