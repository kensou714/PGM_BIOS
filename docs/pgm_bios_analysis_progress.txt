PGM BIOS Function Analysis Progress
===================================

Scope
-----
- Target binary: PGM BIOS (pgm_p01s.u20) loaded at base 0x000000 via IDA + MCP.
- Objective: document every discovered function (80 total from MCP unctions --count 100).
- Output convention: one file per function stored under docs/pgm_bios_sub_<ADDR>.txt with assembly, annotated C, and analysis notes.

Completed
---------
1. sub_D22 (docs/pgm_bios_sub_D22.txt) ? 32-byte block copy helper.
2. sub_DC8 (docs/pgm_bios_sub_DC8.txt) ? sequential word copy helper.

In Progress / TODO
------------------
- Next candidates (in address order): sub_E10, sub_F40, sub_F8A.
- Confirm argument naming by cross-referencing callers inside IDA where necessary.
- Capture any discovered global state or hardware register usage in the analysis notes for reuse.

Workflow Reminders
------------------
- Keep IDA running with the PGM BIOS IDB and the ida-pro-mcp plugin listening on port 13337.
- Use the MCP client from repo root, e.g. python ida_mcp_client.py --port 13337 disassemble 0x0e10.
- After writing each analysis file, append the function name here under "Completed" and adjust the TODO list to point at the next targets.
- Preserve ASCII encoding when updating docs.

Open Questions
--------------
- Need to verify whether any helper relies on implicit global variables (BIOS RAM) that should be documented alongside the function description.
- Identify whether any functions call into Z80 co-processor routines; note linkage when found.
