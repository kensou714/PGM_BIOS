PGM BIOS Function: sub_D3B2 (Queue Pointer Placeholder)
-------------------------------------------------
Summary: Saves `d2/a2/a3`, loads the caller-supplied pointer into `a2`, then immediately restores the registers and returns. It exists solely to provide an overridable entry point for later revisions; in this BIOS build the body is effectively a no-op.

Assembly (trimmed):
  D3B2: movem.l d2/a2-a3, -(sp)
  D3B6: movea.l 0x0C(sp), a2   ; load argument
  D3BA: bra.s D408             ; jump to epilogue
  D408: movem.l (sp)+, d2/a2-a3
  D40C: rts

Behaviour:
```c
void pgm_queue_hook(void *ctx) {
    (void)ctx;  // intentionally unused in this revision
}
```

Analysis notes:
- Although it currently does nothing, sub_D58E invokes this helper after pushing a pointer to `unk_803730`, hinting that some BIOS versions replace this routine with code that iterates a command queue.
- Keeping the register save/restore ensures forward binary compatibility: later firmwares can patch only the body without touching call sites.
- Callers must not rely on the pointer persisting anywhere; any required side effects must be implemented in future overrides.
