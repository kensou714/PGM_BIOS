PGM BIOS Function: sub_190C (Pending Index Stub)
----------------------------------------------
Summary: Returns zero. In the production BIOS this would likely fetch the identifier of the next pending event; in this ROM revision it is stubbed out.

Assembly listing:
```asm
0x190c: moveq #0, d0
0x190e: rts
```

Reconstructed C implementation:
```c
uint32_t pgm_pending_index(void) {
    return 0;
}
```

Analysis notes:
- Paired with sub_1910 in several routines; both are currently placeholders.
- Replace with hardware-specific logic when porting to an environment where the event mechanism is active.
