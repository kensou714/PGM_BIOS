PGM BIOS Helper: sub_D874 (Unsigned Division)
------------------------------------------
Summary: Implements 32-bit ? 16-bit division, returning quotient in D0 and remainder in D1. Handles large dividends by decomposing the operand and calling itself recursively, and falls back to a shift/subtract routine when the divisor exceeds 0xFFFF.

Key behaviour:
- If divisor < 0x10000: uses 68K `divu` when possible; otherwise performs a manual long division with shifting (`dbf` loop).
- Returns quotient in `d0`, remainder in `d1`.
- Preserves D2/D3 in cases that require extended precision.

Usage:
- Called from helper routines (sub_7F6A, sub_46C4, etc.) to convert accumulators into averaged values (seconds, minutes).
- Often followed by `sub_D8D8` to split the remainder against 0x3C (60).

Example pseudocode:
```c
uint32_t pgm_div_u32_u16(uint32_t numerator, uint16_t denominator, uint16_t *rem) {
    uint32_t q = numerator / denominator;
    uint16_t r = numerator % denominator;
    if (rem) *rem = r;
    return q;
}
```
