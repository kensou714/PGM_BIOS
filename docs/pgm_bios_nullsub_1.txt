PGM BIOS Function: nullsub_1 (Stub)
----------------------------------
Summary: Placeholder subroutine that immediately returns to the caller.

Assembly listing:
```asm
0x190a: rts
```

Reconstructed C implementation:
```c
void pgm_nullsub_1(uint32_t unused) {
    (void)unused;
}
```

Analysis notes:
- Acts as a stub for optional logging or callbacks. Several routines push values onto the stack before calling it.
- Safe to ignore during functional emulation; can be replaced with a no-op or instrumentation hook when re-implementing the BIOS logic.
